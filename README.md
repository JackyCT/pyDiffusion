# pyFSA is a tool for diffusion simulation and diffusivity calculation by Forward Simulation Analysis
Forward Simulation Analysis is a efficient tool to calculate both interdiffusion coefficients and impurity diffusion coefficients from diffusion profiles.

pyFSA combines tools like diffusion simulation, diffusion data smooth, forward simulation analysis, etc. to help people analyze diffusion data efficiently.
